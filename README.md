# Experimenting with MongoDB index creation

This is a small Spring Boot application created to experiment with creating MongoDB indices.

## Prerequisites

* JDK >= 17
* MongoDB or Docker

This is a Spring Boot 3 application, which requires Java 17 or newer.
If you don't have MongoDB installed, you can start an instance with Docker using the following command:

```
docker run --name mongo-indices -d -p27017:27017 mongo
```
